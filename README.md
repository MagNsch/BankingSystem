# Banking System

## Description

This project is a simple banking system where users can manage their accounts by performing basic operations such as creating an account, adding or withdrawing money, and viewing a transaction history. 
The system is designed to keep track of user transactions and provide a basic financial management platform.

## Features

- **Account Creation**: Users can create a new account.
- **Deposit Money**: Users can add money to their account.

   - This will include:
     - Selecting the recipient account.
     - Entering the amount to transfer.
     - Verifying sufficient balance before transfer.
   
2. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Encrypt sensitive account details.
